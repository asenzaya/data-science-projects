# Data Science Personal Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio of data science projects on GitHub! Here, I'll be sharing some of my personal projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

### NYC Taxi Fares Fairness

The main focus of this project was to practice different machine learning classification algorithms and evaluate their performance. The goal was to predict whether or not taxi fares in NYC are fair. LightGBM was selected as the best model, achieving an AUC Roc score of 0.95.

- Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
- Main Measure of Performance: AUC Roc

### Predicting House Prices in Ames, Iowa

The main focus of this project was to challenge myself with a dataset that has an overwhelming amount of features available. Four models were proposed, including two benchmark linear regression models, one random forest regressor, and one gradient boosting regressor. The best models were the random forest regressor and gradient boosting regressor, achieving an RMSE of 0.167 and 0.148, respectively.

- Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- Main Measure of Performance: RMSE (provided by Kaggle upon submission)
