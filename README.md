# Data science personnal projects
 
Welcome to my data science personal project portfolio on GitHub! Here, I'll be sharing some of my personal projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

### NYC taxi fares fairness

This projectâ€™ main focus was to practice different machine learning classification algorithms as well evaluating their performance. The goal was to predict wether or not taxi fares in NYC are fair.

### Titanic survival prediction

The main focus here was to solve a classification challenge as part of a friendly Kaggle competition. The project scored in the top 1000 submissions out of approximately 18000 submissions. The goal was to predict if a person survived based on a set of features that had to be selected, cleaned and engeneered to achieve the best results.
